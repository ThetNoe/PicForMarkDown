## Competitive Nature of Our Electricity Wholesale Market
Up until past 20 years ago, a single utility would own all the power plants and transmission lines to supply electricity for a specific region. It would be responsible to dial up or down its supply according to the demand. However, in today’s competitive businesses landscape, we have an energy wholesale market to meet the demands. The market does short-term demand forecast day-ahead and allows power suppliers to come online and place bids. The market brings in plants online in order of price. As shown in figure 1, renewable energy is the cheapest. So, the market generally brings in the lowest-emission plants first. And every five minutes throughout the day, the market would decide which plant to run to match the supply.

In figure 2, we see that cheap power pants A, B, and C are running at full capacity and D at partial capacity. If more load come in, plant D will run at full capacity to meet the demand. So, what is load and load shifting? According to [GridBeyond](https://gridbeyond.com/load-shifting-low-down-guide/), load shifting essentially means moving electricity consumption or electric loads from one time period to another.

### Marginal Vs Average Emissions
Referring back to figure 2, the average emissions would be the average of plant A, B, C and part of D. Average emissions are calculated across all generators by using the total carbon emission and total amount of electricity generated. Therefore, it’s not suitable to use for load shifting evaluations.
On the other hand, marginal emissions is calculated based on the relationship between decision and consequence. (Corradi, 2019) “The marginal emissions are the emissions that would come online if new loads were added.”( Listgarten, 2019). Going back to the figure 2 example, the marginal emissions are from plant D. Due to the “cheapest run first” rule in our energy market, marginal emissions are generally higher than average emissions. Therefore, in the context of evaluating load shifting, marginal emission will be more accurate if our goal is trying to lower our overall carbon emission.
However, unlike average emissions, marginal emissions are not easily available and extremely volatile. Take one good example that Listgarten (2019) gave.

The graph above shows the energy supply on May 3rd, 2019. At 1:27 PM on that day, the average emissions were 284 lbs/MWh and marginal emissions were 1012lbs/MWh. There is a considerable amount of difference between average and marginal emission. This was caused by a sudden drop in solar and rise of natural
gas at 1:27PM. At around 1:50PM, the solar came back up and marginal emissions dropped again. Even within a 30-minute time frame, marginal emissions are hard
to predict and volatile. Companies today with flexible load are using [WattTime](https://www.watttime.org/aer/what-is-aer/) Automated Emission Reduction (AER) technology to lower the emission by automatically scheduling their load with cleaner energy and avoid dirtier energy
